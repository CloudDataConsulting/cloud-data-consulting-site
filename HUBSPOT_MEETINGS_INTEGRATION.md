# HubSpot Integration Strategy

## ðŸŽ¯ **Your Current HubSpot Setup**

Based on your screenshots, you have:
- âœ… **HubSpot Meetings** configured
- âœ… **Custom domain**: `hs.clouddataconsulting.com`
- âœ… **Meetings URL**: `meetings.hubspot.com/berniepruss`
- âœ… **Calendar sync** enabled

## ðŸ“‹ **Two-Pronged CTA Strategy**

### **Strategy 1: Direct Meeting Booking**
**Use for**: "Schedule Consultation", "Book a Meeting", "Schedule Strategy Session"

**How it works:**
- Button links directly to your HubSpot meeting scheduler
- Prospect picks time from your calendar
- Automatic calendar invites and reminders
- No form - just calendar booking

**Your Meeting URL**: 
- Default: `meetings.hubspot.com/berniepruss`
- Custom: `hs.clouddataconsulting.com/berniepruss` (if configured)

### **Strategy 2: Lead Capture Forms**
**Use for**: "Get AI Readiness Score", "Contact Us", "Download Resources"

**How it works:**
- HubSpot form captures detailed lead information
- Can ask qualifying questions (company size, industry, etc.)
- Leads go into your CRM for nurturing
- You follow up to schedule meetings

## ðŸ”§ **Next Steps to Complete Setup**

### Step 1: Test Your Meeting Link
1. **Visit**: `meetings.hubspot.com/berniepruss`
2. **Check**: Does it show your calendar and allow booking?
3. **Note**: What's the exact URL you want to use?

### Step 2: Choose Your Meeting Domain
From your screenshot, you can use:
- `meetings.hubspot.com` (default)
- `hs.clouddataconsulting.com` (custom - more professional)

### Step 3: Update CTAs by Type

**Direct Meeting Booking** (I'll update these):
- Homepage: "Schedule Consultation" 
- Service pages: "Schedule Strategy Session"
- About page: "Schedule Consultation"

**Lead Capture Forms** (Need to create):
- "Get Your AI Readiness Score" â†’ Custom form with qualifying questions
- "Contact Us" â†’ General contact form
- Future: "Download Guide" â†’ Resource forms

## ðŸš€ **Immediate Action Plan**

### What I Need from You:
1. **Test your meeting link**: Visit `meetings.hubspot.com/berniepruss` and confirm it works
2. **Choose domain**: Do you want to use the custom domain `hs.clouddataconsulting.com`?
3. **Share the exact URL** you want me to use for meeting bookings

### What I'll Do Next:
1. **Update all "Schedule Consultation" buttons** to link directly to your meeting scheduler
2. **Keep the contact page** for the lead capture form (we'll still create this)
3. **Create separate AI Assessment page** with detailed form

## ðŸ’¡ **Benefits of This Approach**

**Meeting Links:**
- âœ… Faster conversion (one click to book)
- âœ… Automatic calendar management
- âœ… Professional booking experience
- âœ… No additional setup needed

**Contact Forms:**
- âœ… Capture detailed lead information
- âœ… Qualify prospects before meetings
- âœ… Build email list for nurturing
- âœ… Track marketing attribution

## ðŸŽ¯ **Your Call**

**Should I:**
1. Update all "Schedule Consultation" buttons to point to your HubSpot meeting link?
2. Keep the contact forms for "Get AI Readiness Score" and general inquiries?

**Please confirm:**
- Your preferred meeting URL
- Whether you want to use the custom domain
- If this strategy makes sense for your business process

This approach gives you both immediate meeting bookings AND detailed lead capture!
