Cloud Data Consulting is a boutique data strategy and data engineering firm helping mid-market companies modernize their data stacks, enable analytics, and prepare for AI.

We specialize in Snowflake, dbt, Fivetran, and modern BI tools like Looker and Sigma. Our core service offering is the AI-Ready Data Program, a structured engagement to help companies align their data infrastructure, governance, and reporting with their long-term AI ambitions.

Our clients are typically CTOs, CIOs, or Heads of Data at companies doing $50M+ in revenue with at least a small internal data team.

We emphasize business outcomes over raw tech — faster time-to-insight, lower data costs, improved compliance, and better executive visibility.
